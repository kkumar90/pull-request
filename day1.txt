History of Unix and Linux

Game : Space war game

DOS : single user single processer
windows : single user multi processer

Unix : Ken Thompson Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Minix : In the early 1980s, Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum created a small Unix-like operating system called Minix

Linux :  In 1991, a 21-year-old student named Linus Torvalds

The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix

Unix is licensed , Linux is FREE

Linux File Hierarchy Structure
============================

Diagram

The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.

/(Root)        : Every single file and directory start from the root directory.
/bin           : Contains binary executables.cat, ls, cp etc are here
/boot         : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.
/dev         : Include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
/etc         : Contains configuration files required by all programs.
/home        : Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
/tmp         : Temporary files.
